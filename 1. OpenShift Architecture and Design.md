## Internet access for OpenShift Container Platform

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you require access to the internet to install your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

- Access OpenShift Cluster Manager to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.

- Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.

- Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

**Prerequisites**

- You reviewed details about the OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
- You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
- If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you configured the firewall to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.



## Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.


## Required machines for cluster installation

The smallest OpenShift Container Platform clusters require the following hosts:

|Hosts  |	Description |
|-----------|---------------|
|One temporary bootstrap machine   | The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after you install the cluster. |
|Three control plane machines   | The control plane machines run the Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform services that form the control plane.    |
|At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.| The workloads requested by OpenShift Container Platform users run on the compute machines.|


> [!IMPORTANT]
> To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for these cluster machines.

The bootstrap and control plane machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system. However, the compute machines can choose between Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 and later.

> [!NOTE]
> RHCOS is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.


### Network connectivity requirements

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the hostnames of all other machines in the cluster.

Ports used for all-machine to all-machine communications 
|Protocol |	Port |	Description|
|---------|------|-------------|
| ICMP | N/A | Network reachability tests |
| TCP | N/A | IPsec IKE packets |
| UDP | 4789 | VXLAN |
|     | 6081 | Geneve  |
|     | 9000-9999 | Host level services, including the node exporter on ports 9100-9101  |
|     | 500 | IPsec IKE packets  |
|     | 4500 | IPsec NAT-T packets  |
| TCP/UDP| 30000-32767  | Kubernetes node port |
| ESP| N/A | IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)|


### Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:


Minimum resource requirements

|Machine 	|Operating System 	|CPU [1] 	|RAM 	|Storage 	|Input/Output Per Second (IOPS)[2]|
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------------------------------|
Bootstrap   | RHCOS  | 4    | 16 GB | 100 GB | 300 |
Control Plane   | RHCOS  | 4    | 16 GB | 100 GB | 300 |
